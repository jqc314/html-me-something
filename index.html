<p> The Blues defeated the Jets in six games. For the first time since the 2004 Western Conference Finals, the away team won the first five games in the series. In game one, rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington made 24 saves to give St. Louis a 2–1 victory.  Oskar Sundqvist scored twice for the Blues in game two taking the triumph 4–3.  In game three, Winnipeg forward Kyle Connor scored twice in a 6–3 victory.  Game four remained scoreless until the third period in which both teams notched a goal; however, in overtime Connor scored the winning-goal for the Jets tying the series 2–2 in a 2–1 affair. His goal also Winnipeg's first playoff overtime goal in franchise history. Winnipeg took a two-goal lead in game five, but St. Louis tied the game in the third period and with 15 seconds left, Jaden Schwartz scored to give St. Louis a 3–2 victory. Schwartz scored a natural hat trick in game six as the Blues hung on to a 3–2 series clinching victory.
