          The Blues defeated the Jets in six games. For the first time since the
          2004 Western Conference Finals, the away team won the first five games
          in the series. In game one, rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington made
          24 saves to give St. Louis a 2–1 victory. Oskar Sundqvist scored twice
          for the Blues in game two taking the triumph 4–3. In game three,
          Winnipeg forward Kyle Connor scored twice in a 6–3 victory. Game four
          remained scoreless until the third period in which both teams notched
          a goal; however, in overtime Connor scored the winning-goal for the
          Jets tying the series 2–2 in a 2–1 affair. His goal also Winnipeg's
          first playoff overtime goal in franchise history. Winnipeg took a
          two-goal lead in game five, but St. Louis tied the game in the third
          period and with 15 seconds left, Jaden Schwartz scored to give St.
          Louis a 3–2 victory. Schwartz scored a natural hat trick in game six
          as the Blues hung on to a 3–2 series clinching victory.

          The Blues defeated the Stars in seven games. Vladimir Tarasenko scored
          twice for the Blues in game one, holding the Stars to a close 3–2
          victory. In game two, the Stars bounced back with rookie Roope Hintz
          scoring two goals and adding an assist in a 4–2 win. With 1:38 left in
          the third period of game three, Patrick Maroon put the Blues ahead 4–3
          holding on the lead for the victory. Ben Bishop held the fort for the
          Stars, making 27 saves in game four for a 4–2 triumph. Bishop
          continued his goal-tending prowess into game five, stopping 38 shots
          for the Stars in a 2–1 victory. The Blues scored 33 seconds apart in
          the third period of game six to force a seventh game winning 4–1. In
          game seven, although Stars goaltender Ben Bishop made a valiant effort
          stopping 52 shots, Patrick Maroon's goal at 5:50 of double-overtime
          sent the Blues to the Western Conference Finals defeating Dallas 2–1.

        <p class="blue-p">
          The Blues defeated the Sharks in six games. In game one, Logan Couture
          and Timo Meier both scored twice in the Sharks' 6–3 victory. Although
          Couture scored twice in game two, the Blues edged the Sharks 4–2. In
          game three, controversy struck in overtime as Meier swatted at the
          puck with his glove towards Erik Karlsson who scored in overtime. The
          NHL later admitted the refs missed the hand pass Meier committed. The
          Blues were undeterred by this blatant non-call as goalie Jordan
          Binnington made 29 saves in game four en route to a 2–1 victory. In
          game five, Jaden Schwartz scored a hat trick and Binnington stopped
          all 21 shots he faced for the Blues in a 5–0 victory. The Blues shut
          down the Sharks in game six, scoring five goals in a 5–1 victory and
          advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals and ending its 49-year appearance
          drought. With the Blues advancing to the Finals only five active
          franchises have never won their conference since the playoffs went to
          a conference based format in 1982 (Arizona, Columbus, Minnesota,
          Toronto and Winnipeg).
